# Magic 8 Ball Website

The purpose of this project was to recreate the effects of using a magic 8 ball. This was created with the guidance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlcoJVn8y3I">Carla Codes Magic 8 Ball Tutorial</a>. For the past few months, I have been learning Javascript so to be able to combine this knowledge with CSS and HTML to create a functioning website was a learning curve. I am satisfied with the results and have learned how JavaScript has the ability to manipulate CSS elements to create functioning code.
